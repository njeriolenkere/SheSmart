it was not east to create a react app because npm kept reacting
npm error code ECONNRESET
npm error errno ECONNRESET
npm error network request to https://registry.npmjs.org/create-react-app failed, reason: Client network socket disconnected 
before secure TLS connection was established
To refactor the React code into reusable components, we will break down the application into smaller, more manageable parts. This will make the code more readable, easier to maintain, and reusable.

npm cache verify 
npm cache clean --force
npm install -g npm
npx create-react-app learn-coding-app

1. Create the following components:

    Header.js: Displays the application header.
    ProgressBar.js: Manages the progress bar.
    LessonContent.js: Handles displaying the lesson content.
    Quiz.js: Manages the quiz functionality.
    CodeEditor.js: Encapsulates the code editor functionality.
    Chatbot.js: Handles the chatbot interface.
    NavigationButtons.js: Manages navigation between lessons.
    App.js: Orchestrates all the components.


To address all issues (including breaking changes), run:  
  npm audit fix --force

Run `npm audit` for details.

Success! Created learn-coding-app at C:\Users\Njeri\Desktop\TheComputerGirls\learn-coding-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:      

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.     

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd learn-coding-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!
